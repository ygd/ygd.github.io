# Hi, I am Yasin Güzeldal

I studied communications design in Cologne. Developing corporate designs, focusing on typography, designing websites and applications was my thing.

Currently I am working at [InVision][invision]. A cool place to work. Nice colleagues, flat hirachy, [awesome food][invision-chefs-twitter], best location in Düsseldorf and a beautiful new office. And a lot of room to learn.

I already knew HTML and CSS but at InVision I got to a new level. I am using [VIM][vim] as my default editor, quiet familiar with command line and Git/GitHub, learned a lot about front-end development and my journey is going trough [Ruby on Rails][ruby-on-rails] at the moment. Thanks for that InVision.

To sum up, I realized how amazing it is to write clean code, develope a strong brand, design a beautiful interface and finally see it working. And guess what this blog is about …
