# Hi, I am Yasin Güzeldal

I studied communications design in Cologne. Developing
corporate designs, focusing on typography, designing websites and applications
was my thing.

Currently I am working at InVision. A cool place to work. Nice colleagues, flat
hirachy, awesome food, best location in Düsseldorf and a beautiful new office.
And a lot of room to learn.

I already knew HTML and CSS but at InVision I got to a new level. I am
using VIM as my default editor, quiet familiar with command line and Git/GitHub,
learned a lot about frontend development and my journey is going trough Ruby on
Rails at the moment. Thanks for that InVision.

To sum up, I realized how amazing it is to write clean code, develope a strong
brand, design a beautiful interface and finally see it working. And guess what
this blog is about …
